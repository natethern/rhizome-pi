1. Linking library

  All procedures and syntaxes discussed in this document are already included
  in piw. Thus, no special operation is needed for running programs on piw.
  Pisc and pisf includes only syntaxes below, so no special operation is needed
  for compilation also. To produce executable by linking compiled modules,
  some of following library modules must be linked together.

  Below is the list of module names and its functionalities.
	rp_wwsyn	Definition of syntaxes.
	rp_wwutl	Utility procedures used in other modules.
	rp_wwapi	Definitions of commonly used Win32 API.
	rp_wwbas	Basic procedures.
	rp_wwui		Procedures to handle menus, dialogs and such.
	rp_wwdlg	Common dialogs concerning with files and printing.
	rp_wwtrm	Terminal window.
  Normally, compiled application does not need rp_wwsyn (it is already linked
  into pisc and pisf). Most applications needs rp_wwutl, rp_wwapi, rp_wwbas
  and they must be linked in this order. Remaining modules rp_wwui, rp_wwdlg,
  rp_wwtrm is needed when procedures in corresponding sections below are used.
  Entities of these modules are included in runtime DLL, so normally no
  additional object files are needed. To make executable which runs without
  runtime DLL (-static linking), these modules must be extracted from
  additional library rhzww.lib (librhzww.a for cygwin).

  For example, to make application myapp.exe by linking user module myapp which
  uses rp_wwui and rp_wwdlg, do the following.

	pisl -o myapp -windows -xm debugger \
		rp_wwutl: rp_wwapi: rp_wwbas: rp_wwui: rp_wwdlg: myapp

  And to link statically, do the following.

	pisl -static -o myapp -windows -xm debugger -aux rhzww.lib \
		rp_wwutl: rp_wwapi: rp_wwbas: rp_wwui: rp_wwdlg: myapp

  In cygwin environment, replace '-aux rhzww.lib' by '-aux -lrhzww'.
  Currently, only debugger can be ommitted among basic modules.

2. Calling API

  Win32 APIs which are used in other parts of library or conciderd as be used
  in almost all applications are defined in rp_wwapi. They are named from their
  original name of entry by converting according to following rules.

  a) Regard text beginning with captal and followed by small letters as a word.
    Insert hyphen between words. As exception, contiguous capitals like 'DC'
    are regarded as word.
  b) Use only ANSI version if API has both ANSI and UNICODE versions. Trailing
    'A' is not regarded as a part of name.
  c) Make procedure name on Scheme by adding 'rp:win32api-' to top.

  Example: CreateWindowExA => rp:win32api-create-window-ex
	   GetDC => rp:win32api-get-dc

  APIs which are not defined in rp_wwapi can be defined by following syntaxes.

(rp:ww-load-system-dll id name)					syntax
  Load module including API in subject and name its handle. Id is a symbol and
  becomes the name of handle. Name is a string naming the module.

(rp:ww-load-api-entry name dll entry return-type (argument-type ...))	syntax
(rp:ww-book-api-entry name dll entry return-type (argument-type ...))	syntax
  Define API procedure. Name is a symbol which specifies the name of procedure
  in Scheme and the symbol augmented by 'rp:win32api-' becomes name of defined
  procedure. Dll specifies module which includes the API by the symbol used in
  previously executed rp:ww-load-system-dll. Entry is a name of API specified
  by string. Return-type and argument-type ... are types of return value and
  arguments specified in the same manner as in rp:entry->procedure.

  Rp:ww-load-api-entry and rp:ww-book-api-entry have identical syntax and
  functionality. Rp:ww-load-api-entry loads desired entry immediately, while
  using rp:ww-book-api-entry, loading of entry is done only when defined
  procedure is invloked first time. To define API used in application, use
  rp:ww-load-api-entry. Use rp:ww-book-api-entry if you want to define APIs
  exhaustively disregarding whether each API is used or not.

  If (rp:dbg-set-flag 'rp:ww-api-arg #t) is in effect when rp:ww-load-api-entry
  macro is expanded or procedure defined by rp:ww-book-api-entry is first
  invoked, defined procedure is made to do type check before actually issueing
  API call. In this case, when argument of wrong type is passed, error of type
  (rp:ww-api-arg-error name index type value) is generated. Name is the name of
  procedure, index of index of argument which has wrong type, type is type name
  the argument must be of and value is the value of passed argument.

  DLLs below are loaded already in rp_wwapi, so they can be used in
  rp:ww-load-api-entry and rp:ww-book-api-entry without explicitly loading.
	(rp:ww-load-system-dll kernel "kernel32.dll")
	(rp:ww-load-system-dll user "user32.dll")
	(rp:ww-load-system-dll gdi "gdi32.dll")
	(rp:ww-load-system-dll comdlg "comdlg32.dll")

  Many APIs are accompanied with relating definitions of constants and
  structures to be used with them. Many definitions of constants and structures
  adjunct to APIs included in rp_wwapi are installed in library directory so
  they can be loaded using rp:use-macro-package. Naming convention for them
  is as following.

  a) Replace underscore charecter with hyphen.
  b) Augment prefix 'win:' to names of structures. If element name has prefix
    comming from Hungerian notaion, remove it.
  c) Group constants with common prefixes delimited by underscore and
    the common prefix augmented by 'win:' becomes the name of constants or
    flag set. Remove the common prefix from each constant names and make them
    elements of constants or flag set. Flag set 'win:' is defined for constants
    without common prefix.

  Example: IDOK => (win: iodk)
	   WS_OVERWRAPPEDWINDOW => (win:ws overlappedwindow)
	   POINT => win:point (Elements are x and y.)

  To find out which file have the definition of desired constants and
  structures, consult to source files in pi/win32/win32mcr.

3. Procedures with options

  Some procedures duscussed below take option arguments. It is indicated by
  argument list in synopsis ending with 'option ...'.
  To specify value of option when calling them, list symbol of option name
  and corresponding value alternatively. Of cource, all option name arguments
  are evaluated because they are arguments of procedure call. So normally
  they are quoted.

  If undefined option is specified, error of type (rp:no-option opt) arises.
  Opt is the undefined option in concern. Same error arrises when identical
  option is specified more than once.

4. Errors

(rp:ww-windows-error [errcode])					procedure
  Generate error of type (rp:ww-windows-error errcode errdesc). If errcode is
  not specified, it defaults to the return value of GetLastError. Errdesc is
  error message string corresponding to errcode.

5. Window classes and window procedures

(rp:ww-make-window-class dispatcher option ...)			procedure
	[option]			[default]
	style		style		0
	cls-extra	cbClsExtra	0
	wnd-extra	cbWndExtra	0
	instance	hInstance	hInstance of process
	icon		hIcon		IDI_APPLICATION
	cursor		hCursor		IDC_ARROW
	background	hbrBackground	COLOR_WINDOW
	menu-name	lpszMenuName	NULL
	class-name	lpszClassName	Generated internally
	icon-sm		hIconSm		NULL
  Registers window class. Use return value of this procedure as an argument of
  rp:ww-create-window. Dispatcher describes window procedure and this is
  generated by rp:ww-message-dispatcher discussed next. As a value of option
  like icon, specify handle of resource of appropriate type. Each value of
  option gives corresponding element of WNDCLASSEX structure.

(rp:ww-message-dispatcher (wnd message wparam lparam)
  (msg exp ...) ...)						syntax
  Generate window procedure description which can be used as argument of
  rp:ww-make-window-class. Arguments of window procedure is bound to wnd,
  message, wparam, lparam and these binding is visible in each exp.
  Msg specifies message and exp's in selected clause are eveluated.
  Inside this syntax, following procedures rp:ww-set-user-data,
  rp:ww-get-user-data and rp:ww-delete-user-data are available.
  For message without matching clause, DefWindowProc will be called.

(rp:ww-set-user-data wnd lparam)				procedure
  Defined locally in rp:ww-message-dispatcher. This can be used only to
  process WM_NCCREATE or WM_CREATE message. Pass wnd and lparam of
  rp:ww-message-dispatcher as arguments. After this procedure is called,
  rp:ww-get-user-data procedure become available in subsequent processing of
  messages.

(rp:ww-get-user-data wnd)					procedure
  Defined locally in rp:ww-message-dispatcher. Before using this procedure,
  rp:ww-set-user-data must be called in responce to WM_NCCREATE or WM_CREATE
  message. To use this procedure in processing of messages sent before
  WM_CREATE message is sent, call rp:ww-set-user-data in responce to
  WM_NCCREATE message. Notice that WM_GETMINMAXINFO is sent even before
  WM_NCCREATE is sent. Argument wnd is wnd variable of
  rp:ww-message-dispatcher. This procedure returns the object specified as
  data argument of rp:ww-create-window.

(rp:ww-delete-user-data wnd)					procedure
  Defined locally in rp:ww-message-dispatcher. Usually this procedure is called
  in responce to WM_NCDESTROY or WM_DESTROY message. Call this procedure only
  when rp:ww-set-user-data is called. Argument wnd is wnd variable of
  rp:ww-message-dispatcher. This procedure frees resource reserved for process
  rp:ww-get-user-data procedure.

(rp:ww-replace-window-procedure wnd dispatcher)			procedure
  Replaces window procedure of window wnd (that is, does so-called instance
  subclassing). Dispatcher describes new window procedure and generated by
  rp:ww-subclass-dispatcher discussed below.

(rp:ww-replace-class-procedure class dispatcher)		procedure
  Replaces window procedure of class with name class (that is, does so-called
  global subclassing). Specify class as string. Dispatcher describes new
  window procedure and generated by rp:ww-subclass-dispatcher discussed below.

(rp:ww-make-derived-class oclass nclass dispatcher option ...)	procedure
	[option]					[default]
	instance	Instance which owns oclass.	NULL
	modify-class	Procedure to modify class.	Does nothing.
  Create new window class with name nclass besed upon existing class with name
  oclass (that is, does so-called superclassing). Dispatcher describes new
  window procedure and generated by rp:ww-subclass-dispatcher discussed below.
  If base class is created by some module, pass its instance handle as the
  value of instance option. If base class is a system control class, instance
  option is not necessary. To modify characteristics of class other than
  window procedure, specify option modify-class. Value of this option is
  procedure with one argument and called with WNDCLASSEX structure just before
  RegisterClassEx is called.

(rp:ww-subclass-dispatcher (wnd message wparam lparam)
  (msg exp ...) ...)						syntax
  Generate window procedure description for subclassing. Inside this syntax,
  following procedure rp:ww-call-base-procedure is available. For massages
  without matching clause, window procedure of original class will be called.

(rp:ww-call-base-procedure wnd message wparam lparam)		procedure
  Defined locally in rp:ww-subclass-dispatcher. Calls window procedure of
  original class.

(rp:ww-command-dispatcher (wnd id cmd ctl udat)
  (((sel ...) code) exp ...) ...)				syntax
  Describe processing of WM_COMMAND. This expression itself is evaluated to
  procedure,say proc, shall be called as (proc wnd wparam lparam udat).
  Arguments wnd, wparam, lparam are arguments of window procedure as is and
  udat may be arbitrarly value.
  Evaluates exp's in the clause to which specification of sel and code
  processed command matches. In exp, variables wnd, id, cmd, ctl, udat are
  bound. Wnd and udat are arguments of calling form, id and cmd are
  control/menu ID and notification code given by splitting wparam, ctl is
  handle of control given by type casting of lparam.
  By (sel ...), control/menu ID is selected. If hyphen appears in this list,
  range of ID values are selected. Notify code is selected by code and '*'
  indecates all code will match. The clause which both condition matches is
  selected.

  title is a string which will be text of window, data may be arbitrarly
  abject and will be value of rp:ww-get-user-data in window procedure.
  If value other than #f is specified for show option, ShowWindow is called
  passing the value as nCmdShow argument. Other options specify corresponding
  arguments of CreateWindowEx.

  Destroys object.

(rp:ww-printer-page-setup this wnd option ...)			method
  Invokes PageSetupDlg. Option is passed to rp:ww-comdlg-page-invoke.

(rp:ww-printer-print this wnd option ...)			method
  Does printing. Option is passed to rp:ww-comdlg-page-invoke.

(rp:ww-printer-print-ok? this dc wnd)				method
  Implemented by application if application wants to decide wheter printing
  is possible to specified printer. The device context get from PrintDlg
  is passed as dc. Wnd is argument to rp:ww-printer-print. Printing is not
  done if this method returned #f.

(rp:ww-printer-cancel-dialog-template this)			method

(rp:ww-printer-render-document this dc cancel-dialog render-page abort)	method
  This method must be implemented by apllication describing body of printing.
  Dc is a printer device context, cancel-dialog is a handle of calcel dialog
  box, render-page is a prcedure of one argument, abort is a procedure with no
  arguments. One page of output is done when render-page is called. Pass its
  argument a prcedure with no arguments, this procedure does rendering of
  output page. When abort is called, printing is cancelled. Abort does not

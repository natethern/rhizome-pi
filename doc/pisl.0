       If  invoked  with --hheellpp option, ppiissll Outputs brief summary
       of command line syntax. Otherwise ppiissll binds modules spec-
       ified  by  _m_o_d_u_l_e_-_s_p_e_c_i_f_i_e_r  together  and  generates exe-
       cutable file.

       --cccc _c_c_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_l_i_n_e
              Specify command line  of  C  compiler.  Default  is
              printed in the output of `pisl -help'.

       --lldd _l_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_l_i_n_e
              Specify  command line of linker. Default is printed
              in the output of `pisl -help'.

       --nnoolldd  Supress execution of linker.

       --nnoolliibb Supress linking  with  default  run  time  library.
              Default  library  specification  is  printed in the
              output of `pisl -help'.

       --llooaaddaabbllee
              Create shared object insted of executable.  Result-
              ing  object can be loaded by the procedure rp:load-
              compiled-module.  In some environment, this  option
              is not supported.

       --ssttaattiicc
              Make  resulting  executable  run  without  specific
              shared object.  Size  of  executable  file  becomes
              substantially  large.  In  some  environment,  this
              option is always in effect.

       --mmooddlliibb
              Create shared object which can  be  used  as  input
              module  file  at  another  pisl invocation. In some
              environment, this option is not supported.

       --wwiinnddoowwss
              This option has effect only in Win32 platform. When
              this  is  specified, pisl generates GUI application
              of Win32. Generated executable  launches  detatched
              from  console  and  gets  its  own  console when it
              accesses console first time.

       --oo _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Specify the name of executable file  generated.  If

              this option is not specified, linker determines the
              name of executable.

       --ss _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Specify the name of file that contains startup code
              (the  code  wich calls each initialization routines
              of linked modules.)  This file will  be  the  first
              modules  passed to linker. Default is, if -o option
              is specified, the value of it  prepended  "s_"  and
              appended ".c", "a.c" othewise.

       --bbaassee _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
              Specify  base  address  of  output  file. Format of
              address specification depends on your linker. Spec-
              ifying  base  address  is said to be useful in some
              environment.

       --xxmm _m_o_d_u_l_e
              Omit specified  standard  module  from  executable.
              _M_o_d_u_l_e shall be one of the following.
              eexxppaanndd Hygienic  macro  feature  with  syntax-case.
                     Some  syntaxes  will  change  its   behavior
                     slightly  if  this  is  omitted, though this
                     should not affect normal programs.
              ssttddmmaaccrroo
                     Standard marcros. In rhizome/pi, basic  syn-
                     tax  kyewords  such  as  define,  lambda are
                     impremented as macros, so omitting  stdmacro
                     disables  usage  of them. If application has
                     no feature to evaluate arbitrary  expression
                     specified  at  run time, you can safely omit
                     this.
              ddeebbuuggggeerr
                     Debugging features.
              ssttddpprroocc
                     Built in procedures  implemented  in  scheme
                     code at rhizome/pi. Consult to the source to
                     see which procedure will be unusable if this
                     is  omitted  :-) Expand and debugger will be
                     omitted automatically if stdproc is omitted.
              eexxttccaallll
                     Macros  providing  interface to functions in
                     shared objects.  If application need not  to
                     be  able  to define new external procedures,
                     callbacks, buffer structures or constants at
                     run time, you can safely omit this.
              ssaacccceessss
                     Procedures  used  to  expand  macros defined
                     trough macros which belongs to extcall. Sac-
                     cess will be omitted automatically if expand
                     is  omitted  and  if  saccess  is   omitted,
                     extcall will be omitted automatically.
              This option may be used multiple times.

              Add  _s_t_r_i_n_g to the command line of linker. This may
              be used in the purpose of specifying a module  wich
              is  already  in  an object file. This option may be
              used multiple times.

       _m_o_d_u_l_e _M_o_d_u_l_e is the name you specified at --mmoodduullee  option
              to  ppiisscc..   File containing _m_o_d_u_l_e is assumed to be
              named as _m_o_d_u_l_e appended with ".c" suffix.

       _m_o_d_u_l_e_:_f_i_l_e
              _M_o_d_u_l_e is contained in the file named as _f_i_l_e_.

       _m_o_d_u_l_e_:
              _M_o_d_u_l_e is already in object file. Use  --aauuxx  option
              to specify the object file containing it.

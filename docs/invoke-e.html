<a name="Pi"><h2>pi</h2></a>
  Pi is a scheme interpreter.
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>SYNOPSIS
  <dd><code>pi [<var>file</var>] [<var>arguments</var>]</code>
</dl>
</p>
  Pi executes ordinary read-eval-print loop if invoked without any arguments.
  It exits when expression <code>(exit)</code> is evaluated.<br>
  If invoked with command line arguments, pi considers the first argument as
  file name unless it is "--", and loads named file before entering
  read-eval-print loop.
  Subsequent arguments may be used to give parameters to application program.
  To get command line arguments from program, use global variable
  <code>*invocation-arg*</code> or procedure
  <code>rp:command-line-arguments</code>.
  Use "--" as the first argument to give arguments to pi without loading any
  files. If pi is invoked with no arguments or "--" as the first argument, and
  if the environment variable RHIZOME_PI_RC is set, content of it is evaluated
  before entering read-eval-print loop.<br>
  The functionality of pi is implemented by the module rp_pi included in
  standard library. Specifying rp_pi: as the last argument of pisl creates
  scheme interpreter augmented with compiled procedures in other modules linked
  together. In fact, pi itself is reproduced by the command line "pisl rp_pi:".
  In detail, module rp_pi does the following.
  <ol compact start="0">
  <li>At the start of execution, <code>*invocation-arg*</code> contains
      command line.
  <li>If the first argument is "--", delete it from
      <code>*invocation-arg*</code>.
      Otherwise, if there is any argument, delete zeroth argument (the
      command name itself) from <code>*invocation-arg*</code>.
      If there is no argument at all (aside from zeroth one,) remain
      <code>*invocation-arg*</code> intact.
  <li><ol compact type="a">
      <li>If there was no arguments or the first argument was "--",
	  test the environment variable RHIZOME_PI_RC and eval its value if
	  it was set.
      <li>If there was any argument and first of them was not "--", load it.
      </ol>
  <li type="A" value="24">
      If step 2 overs and pi is still executing, break procedure (it is,
      the read-eval-print loop) is invoked with prompt derived from car of
      <code>*invocation-arg*</code>. This is not a facility of module rp_pi in
      fact and done regardless of whether module rp_pi is linked in or not.
  </ol>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>*invocation-arg*</code> global variable
  <dd>Initially, this holds command line arguments as a list. In interpreter
      pi, this list begins with first argument (loaded prorgram). In compiled
      program, this list begins with zeroth argument (name of load module).
      In any case, arguments to program begins from second element, so the same
      logic may be applied to retrieve command line arguments regardless to
      whether program is run under interpreter or is compiled.<br>
      Notice that this is a usual variable and may be assigned to change value
      at will.
  <p>
  <dt><code>(rp:command-line-arguments)</code> procedure
  <dd>Returns command line as a vector. This is a whole command line in any
      situation. No method is provided to change the value of this procedure,
      aside from overwriting the procedure itself.
</dl>
<p>
EXAMPLE
<pre>
$ cat arg.scm
(display "*invocation-arg* is               ")
(write *invocation-arg*)
(newline)
(display "rp:command-line-arguments returns ")
(write (rp:command-line-arguments))
(newline)
(exit)
$ pi arg.scm foo bar baz
*invocation-arg* is               ("arg.scm" "foo" "bar" "baz")
rp:command-line-arguments returns #("pi" "arg.scm" "foo" "bar" "baz")
$ pisc arg.scm
$ pisl arg
gcc -O2 -m486 -I/u/qfwfq/lib/rhizome -c arg.c
gcc -O2 -m486 -I/u/qfwfq/lib/rhizome -c a.c
gcc -L/u/qfwfq/lib/rhizome a.o arg.o -lrhzscm -lrhzpi -lrhizome -lm
$ ./a.out foo bar baz
*invocation-arg* is               ("./a.out" "foo" "bar" "baz")
rp:command-line-arguments returns #("./a.out" "foo" "bar" "baz")
</pre>

<a name="Piw"><h2>piw</h2></a>
  Piw exists only in Win32 platform. This is a scheme interpreter like pi and
  differs only in the following points.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Piw is built as GUI application while pi is a console application. Refer
      to the explanation of -windows option in pisl.
  <li>Into piw, library for making windows application
      (<a href="wwlib-e.txt">ww library</a>) is linked.
</ul>

<a name="Pisc"><h2>pisc</h2></a>
  Pisc is a scheme compiler that converts scheme program to program in
  C language.
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>SYNOPSYS
  <dd><dl>
	<dt><code>pisc -help</code>
	<dd>Outputs brief summary of command line syntax.
	<dt><code>pisc [<var>options</var>] <var>file</var></code>
	<dd>Converts <code><var>file</var></code> to program in C language.
      </dl>
</dl>
<p>
OPTIONS
<dl>
  <dt><code>-module <var>module-identifier</var></code>
  <dd>Gives module name <code><var>module-identifier</var></code>.
      Module name is a name you specify to pisl when creating executable.
      This must be a valid identifier in C language. Default is the name of
      source file without ".scm" suffix (if the file name had one.)
  <dt><code>-output <var>filename</var></code>
  <dd>Specifies file name of output. Defualt is module name with ".c" suffix.
  <dt><code>-mpath <var>dir</var></code>
  <dd>Add <code><var>dir</var></code> to search path of
      <code>rp:use-macro-package</code>.
      This option may be used multiple times.
  <dt><code>-load <var>filename</var></code>
  <dd>Loads named file into the environment of compiler befor reading
      source file. This may be used in the purpose of defining macros
      at compile time. This option may be used multiple times.
</dl>

<a name="Pisf"><h2>pisf</h2></a>
  Pisf converts scheme programs into (in typical cases) easy to load format.
  Generated file can be loaded by load procedure as for source file, but is
  not human readable. Typically, output file is smaller than source file, but
  macro expansion may result in huge outout. For large (after macro is
  expanded) programs, exacution of pisf may take long time. Pisf can optionally
  generate C programs insted of loadable file. In this case, resulting program
  is usually smaller than output of pisf but expressions in source are executed
  by interprester.
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>SYNOPSYS
  <dd><dl>
	<dt><code>pisf -help</code>
	<dd>Outputs brief summary of command line syntax.
	<dt><code>pisf [<var>options</var>] <var>file</var></code>
	<dd>Converts <code><var>file</var></code>.
      </dl>
</dl>
<p>
OPTIONS
<dl>
  <dt><code>-exec <var>interpreter</var></code>
  <dd>Output executable script file for unix like operating systems.
      Specify full pathname of executable to execute the program.
      First line of resulting file will have form
      "#!<code><var>interpreter</var></code>".
  <dt><code>-module <var>module-identifier</var></code>
  <dd>Genarate C program. <code><var>Module-identifier</var></code>
      has the same meaning as in pisc and resulting file can be specified
      as module to pisl as if it was output from pisc.
  <dt><code>-output <var>filename</var></code>
  <dt><code>-mpath <var>dir</var></code>
  <dt><code>-load <var>filename</var></code>
  <dd>These options has the same meaning as in pisc.
</dl>

<a name="Pisl"><h2>pisl</h2></a>
  Pisl compiles programs in C language generated by pisc and links with run
  time libraries to generate executable file.
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>SYNOPSYS
  <dd><dl>
	<dt><code>pisl -help</code>
	<dd>Outputs brief summary of command line syntax.
	<dt><code>pisl [<var>options</var>] <var>module-specifier</var> ...</code>
	<dd>Binds modules specified by <code><var>module-specifier</var></code>
	    together and generates executable file.
      </dl>
</dl>
<p>
OPTIONS
<dl>
  <dt><code>-cc <var>cc-command-line</var></code>
  <dd>Specify command line of C compiler. Default is printed in the
      output of `<code>pisl -help</code>'.
  <dt><code>-ld <var>ld-command-line</var></code>
  <dd>Specify command line of linker. Default is printed in the
      output of `<code>pisl -help</code>'.
  <dt><code>-nold</code>
  <dd>Supress execution of linker.
  <dt><code>-nolib</code>
  <dd>Supress linking with default run time library. Default library
      specification is printed in the output of `<code>pisl -help</code>'.
  <dt><code>-loadable</code>
  <dd>Create shared object insted of executable. Resulting object
      can be loaded by the procedure <code>rp:load-compiled-module</code>.
      In some environment, this option is not supported.
  <dt><code>-static</code>
  <dd>Make resulting executable run without specific shared object.
      Size of executable file becomes substantially large. In some
      environment, this option is always in effect.
  <dt><code>-modlib</code>
  <dd>Create shared object which can be used as input module file
      at another pisl invocation. In some environment, this option
      is not supported.
  <dt><code>-windows</code>
  <dd>This option has effect only in Win32 platform. When this is
      specified, pisl generates GUI application of Win32. Generated
      executable launches detatched from console and gets its own
      console when it accesses console first time.
  <dt><code>-o <var>filename</var></code>
  <dd>Specify the name of executable file generated. If this option
      is not specified, linker determines the name of executable.
  <dt><code>-s <var>filename</var></code>
  <dd>Specify the name of file that contains startup code (the code
      wich calls each initialization routines of linked modules.)
      This file will be the first modules passed to linker. Default
      is, if -o option is specified, the value of it prepended "s_"
      and appended ".c", "a.c" othewise.
  <dt><code>-base <var>address</var></code>
  <dd>Specify base address of output file. Format of address
      specification depends on your linker. Specifying base address
      is said to be useful in some environment.
  <dt><code>-xm <var>module</var></code>
  <dd>Omit specified standard module from executable. Module shall
      be one of the following.
      <table>
      <tr>
	<td valign=top><code>expand</code></td>
	<td>Hygienic macro feature with syntax-case. Some syntaxes
	    will change its behavior slightly if this is omitted,
	    though this should not affect normal programs.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td valign=top><code>stdmacro</code></td>
	<td>Standard marcros. In rhizome/pi, basic syntax kyewords
	    such as define, lambda are impremented as macros, so
	    omitting stdmacro disables usage of them. If
	    application has no feature to evaluate arbitrary
	    expression specified at run time, you can safely omit
	    this.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td valign=top><code>debugger</code></td>
	<td>Debugging features.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td valign=top><code>stdproc</code></td>
	<td>Built in procedures implemented in scheme code at
	    rhizome/pi. Consult to the source to see what will be
	    unusable if this is omitted :-)
	    <code>Expand</code> and <code>debugger</code> will be
	    omitted automatically if stdproc is omitted.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td valign=top><code>extcall</code></td>
	<td>Macros providing interface to functions in shared objects.
	    If application need not to be able to define new external
	    procedures, callbacks, buffer structures or constants at
	    run time, you can safely omit this.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td valign=top><code>saccess</code></td>
	<td>Procedures used to expand macros defined trough macros
	    which belongs to <code>extcall</code>. <code>Saccess</code>
	    will be omitted automatically if <code>expand</code> is
	    omitted and if <code>saccess</code> is omitted,
	    <code>extcall</code> will be omitted automatically.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      This option may be used multiple times.
  <dt><code>-aux <var>string</var></code>
  <dd>Add <code><var>string</var></code> to the command line of linker.
      This may be used in the purpose of specifying a module wich is already
      in an object file. This option may be used multiple times.
</dl>
  Format of <code><var>module-specifier</var></code>
<p>
    Specify names you specified at <code>-module</code> option to pisc as
    <code><var>module-specifier</var></code>.<br>
    If tha name of file which contains the module is not the module name
    appended ".c", specify the file name after ':'. If the module is already
    in object file, specify null string after ':' and specify object file using
    -aux option.
<p>
EXAMPLE<br>
Assume creating a executable from source files x.scm, y.scm, z-0.scm. The
following is one sample of compiling process.
<pre>
pisc x.scm				# generates x.c
pisl -nold x				# generates x.o
pisc y.scm				# generates y.c
pisc -module zz -output z-0.c z-0.scm	# generates z-0.c with module name zz
pisl -aux x.o x: y zz:z-0.c		# generates executable
</pre>
Running generated executable results in the same effact as loading each
source files to the interpreter in the same sequence of module
specification to pisl.
In the above example, assuming the contents of a.scm is
<pre>
	(load "x.scm")
	(load "y.scm")
	(load "z-0.scm")
</pre>
the result will be same with doing
<pre>
	pi a.scm [arguments]
</pre>
If compiled program is written to accomplish <code>(exit)</code> after some
uninteractive operation, resulting executable will be an uninteractive
program. On the other hand, compiling program which only includes some
definitions of procedures, resulting executable will be a scheme
interpreter extended with the predefined procedures. Note, however, if you
want the same behaviour with pi, namely loading its first argument, you
must describe such behaviour in your program (linking with module rp_pi
included in library is sufficient. In fact, pi itself can be reprodeced by
"<code>pisl -o pi rp_pi:</code>".)<br>
It is an error to load same module more than once. Doing so makes program
to terminate abnormally.

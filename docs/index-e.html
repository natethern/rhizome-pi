<h1 align=left>rhizome/pi</h1>

rhizome/pi is a Scheme implementation (interpreter and compiler,
compiler generates program in C language) conforming to
<a href="ftp://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/pub/scheme-reports/">R^5RS</a>.

<a name="Character"><h2>Characteristics</h2></a>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is implemented completely in continuation passing style.
    Being so, it never makes recurseive call in machine labguage
    level, and depth of stack is bound to finite constant (I did
    not investigate the precise limit, but it must be no greater
    than 1 kilobytes.)
  <li>
    Application of call-with-current-continuation and resulting
    comtinuation object is very fast. Execution time of them is
    no greater than normal procedures (such as car, cdr, cons.)
  <li>
    Employes syntax-case as low level macro system.
  <li>
    Aside from trace, there is a debugger capable of single stepping
    of LISP code. This debugger itself is mostly written in LISP
    code, and implementing custom debugging feature is also possible
    (but, procedures for hooking evaluator are not fully documented
    yet.)
  <li>
    Handling errors and signals are possible.
  <li>
    There is no limitation of program which may be compiled. Execution
    of compiled program is done simillary to loading, by sequential
    evaluation of top level expressions.
  <li>
    Shared objects (DLLs in term of Win32) can be loaded dynamically
    and functions in them can be called from scheme code. Moreover,
    callbacks can be written in scheme code.
    See <a href="extfunc-e.txt">doc/extfunc</a> for details.
</ul>
  This implementation is not aimed to solely as tools for study of
  so called artificial intelligence, but intended to be used as a
  general purpose developing and executing environment of applications.
<p>
  rhizome/kappa is a indivisual package consisting of runtime routines
  of rhizome/pi, which will be useful in other symbolic processing languages.

<a name="Environment"><h2>Supported environments</h2></a>
  The author tested the program under following environments and C compilers.
<ul>
  <li>OpenBSD 3.7 i386
  <li>Linux i386
  <li>Win32 (intel) with Microsoft, Borland or lcc-win32 C compiler
  <li>Win32 (intel) with Cygwin environment
</ul>
  There should be no serious problems in porting to other
  <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/call-it-a-duck.html">
  unix like operating systems</a>.
